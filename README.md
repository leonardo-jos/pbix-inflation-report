Include historical inflation rates to provide context.

8.Inflation Rate Analysis:
Calculate inflation rates and their variations.
Provide insights into factors influencing inflation, such as monetary policy, economic indicators, and external shocks.

9. Regional Insights:
Segment countries into regions or economic blocs for comparative analysis.
Analyze how inflation varies within and across regions.
